\section{Conclusion}

In summary, the research question "how machine learning can be used to generate commentary for chess games" could be answered. However, the problem of the intransparency of moves of professional players and engines remains. Although the models provide good insight, they are not yet capable of providing commentary as insightful as that provided by human commentators. Nevertheless, they show "the direction to further developing"\footnote{\cite{zang-etal-2019-automated}, p. 9}, so that this goal can be achieved in the future with high likelihood.
