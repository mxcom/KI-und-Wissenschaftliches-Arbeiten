\section{Conclusion}

In summary, the research question "how machine learning can be used to generate commentary for chess games" could be answered. However, the problem of the intransparency of moves of professional players and engines still remains. Although the models generate commentary that provides a good insight, such insightful commentary as human commentators provide, could not yet be achieved. Nevertheless, they show "the direction to further developing"\footnote{\cite{zang-etal-2019-automated}, p. 9}, so that this goal can be achieved in the future with high likelihood.
