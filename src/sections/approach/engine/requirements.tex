\subsubsection{Requirements}

Any chess engine must meet a number of requirements in order to function. These requirements include the \textit{representation of the chessboard}, the \textit{search of the possible moves} and the \textit{evaluation of the position}.\footnote{Cf. \cite{nnfc-2022}, pp. 75-76} These requirements can be implemented in a number of ways. Certain implementation options have become widely accepted. In the following, one implementation procedure is presented in detail for each requirement. These are state of the art implementations that have been in use for many years or have achieved great success in the recent past.
