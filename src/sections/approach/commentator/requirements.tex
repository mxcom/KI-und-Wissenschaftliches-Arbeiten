\subsubsection{Requirements}

The virtual chess commentator has the task of using certain information provided by the engine and translating it into a format that can be understood by humans. The requirements that the commentator should fulfill are the \textit{description of the current move}, the \textit{description of the move quality}, the \textit{comparison of moves}, the \textit{description of the move planning} and \textit{contextual game information}.\footnote{Cf. Jhamtani et al. 2018 p. 3}$^{,}$\footnote{Zang et al. 2019, pp. 3-4}. The process of generating the text commentary can be summarized into two upper parts, namely encoding and decoding. Encoding describes the preparation of the information so that it can be processed more easily, while decoding describes the translation of the encoded information into a text format.
