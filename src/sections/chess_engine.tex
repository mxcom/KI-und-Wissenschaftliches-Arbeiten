\section{Chess Commentator powered by a Neural Network}

\subsection{General Approach}

In the implementation, it plays an important role what kind and how much information the neural network receives about the analysis of the individual moves in order to generate the most accurate translations possible. This is influenced by the placement of the chess engine, which can be placed either internally or externally. Internal means that the engine works as part of the neural network, which also includes the chess commentator. When placed externally, the neural net is only used for the translations of the chess commentator and uses the analysis of an outside placed engine. In the following, we will only focus on the internal placement, as this achieved the best results.
