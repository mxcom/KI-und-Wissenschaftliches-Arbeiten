% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
This scientific seminar paper deals with the question how machine learning can be used to generate comments on chess games. On the one hand it is shown how a chess engine can be built to analyze games and on the other hand how the information provided by the engine can be used by a virtual chess commentator to generate comments. The engine is built based on a neural network and a Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm and can be trained by self-play. The generation is based on an encoder-decoder model that uses a bidirectional long short-term memory architecture. For a total of five different categories, comments are generated by corresponding generation models, which together form the virtual chess commentator.
